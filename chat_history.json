[{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "RunReady is a mobile app designed for competitors who need precise, reliable estimates of when their horses will run and when pre-run tasks should happen. Users input the event start time, horses-per-hour pace, and each horse\u2019s name and draw number.

The clean, streamlined interface keeps everything on one simple screen\u2014event details at the top, each horse\u2019s info and reminders directly underneath, and quick actions to add another horse, save the schedule, or view today\u2019s runs\u2014making it effortless for riders to check their timeline throughout the day and rely on accurate, automatic alarms for every key preparation step. The UI is intentionally minimal, structured like a clean, single-page calculator that jumps the user directly into the core workflow with no clutter, tabs, or complex navigation. At the top, the \u201cEvent Details\u201d block captures the event start time and horses-per-hour value, followed immediately by stacked horse sections containing fields for horse name, draw number, and an automatically calculated estimated run time. Beneath each horse\u2019s header is a compact table for pre-run notifications, where each row includes a text label, a dropdown offset selector (e.g., \u201c2 hrs\u201d), and a dynamically calculated \u201cFires At\u201d time that updates whenever the run time changes. The design uses clear labels, ample white space, soft rounded cards, and navy-blue accents to maintain clarity and reduce user cognitive load. Key actions\u2014Add Reminder, Add Another Horse, Save Schedule, and View Today\u2019s Runs\u2014are presented as bold, high-contrast buttons at the bottom, keeping everything easily accessible with a thumb.

I've successfully implemented the RunReady app with all the requested features. Here's what I've created:\n\n## Summary of Implementation\n\n### **Core Features:**\n\n1. **Event Details Section** - Captures event start time (with native time picker) and horses-per-hour pace\n2. **Horse Management** - Add multiple horses with name, draw number, and automatically calculated run times\n3. **Pre-Run Notifications** - Each horse can have multiple reminders with:\n   - Custom labels (e.g., \"Lasix\", \"Warm-up\", \"Saddle\")\n   - Offset selector (15 min to 4 hours)\n   - Dynamically calculated \"Fires At\" time\n4. **Action Buttons** - Add Horse, Save Schedule, and View Today's Runs\n\n### **Key Files Created:**\n\n- **`types/horse.ts`** - TypeScript interfaces for Horse, Reminder, and EventDetails\n- **`utils/timeCalculations.ts`** - All time calculation logic (run times, reminder times, formatting)\n- **`components/EventDetailsCard.tsx`** - Event start time and horses-per-hour input\n- **`components/HorseCard.tsx`** - Individual horse details with reminders\n- **`components/ReminderRow.tsx`** - Individual reminder with label, offset, and fire time\n- **`app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`** - Main screen with all functionality (Android/Web)\n- **`app/(tabs)/(home)/index.ios.tsx`** - iOS-specific version\n- **`styles/commonStyles.ts`** - Updated with the specified color scheme\n\n### **Design Highlights:**\n\n- **Clean, minimal interface** - Single-page layout with no complex navigation\n- **Navy blue color scheme** - Primary: #303F9F, Secondary: #9FA8DA, Accent: #FF4081\n- **Automatic calculations** - Run times and reminder fire times update instantly\n- **Responsive layout** - Works on all screen sizes with proper padding for tab bar\n- **Platform-specific code** - Separate iOS and Android implementations where needed\n\n### **How It Works:**\n\n1. User enters event start time and horses-per-hour pace\n2. User adds horses with names and draw numbers\n3. App automatically calculates estimated run time for each horse\n4. User adds reminders for each horse (e.g., \"Lasix - 2 hrs before\")\n5. App shows exact \"Fires At\" time for each reminder\n6. All times update automatically when event details change\n\nThe app is ready to use!
